## 🖥️ System Requirements & Important Notes

~~Definitely in Beta mode atm.~~
I'm going to start over from scratch.

If you manage to get an error on first image generation after install, or when likewise downloading a new checkpoint, restart the app. I think Gradio sometimes get bored waiting and loses the input image.  It's quick after the 1st generation, and should stay quick when changing between the three apps.

Don't forget to refresh the UI when switching between apps!

### Hardware & Storage:
- 32GB RAM for comfortable operation. I wouldn't try with 16GB system RAM.
- 16GB+ VRAM highly recommended.
   - I've explored adding the various VRAM optimizations, but at best, and with model juggling (and excessive memory flushing), it was still a little over 12GB. Not worth it imo.  Maybe someone more experienced can give it a go!
- ~20GB+ free space for download. It downloads the required models on 1st generation (models are shared across the three apps). Additional models can be selected and downloaded in-app.


### For Existing Users

If you already have Diffusers Image Fill installed in Pinokio:

1. Copy the following files from this repo to your `.\api\diffusers-image-fill.git` folder:
   - `pinokio.js`
   - `start.js`
   - `delete-cache.js`
   - `app.py`
   - `app-outpaint.py`
   - `app.zoom.py`
   - `README.md`
     
 2. These files will overwrite existing ones. No additional installation required.

- **App Switching:** Click `Refresh` on the Pinokio top bar when switching between companion apps to update the Gradio webUI.
- **Cache Management:** Use the provided `Delete Gradio Image Cache` button periodically to manage temporary images in the Gradio cache.

- **Project Status:** This is an enhanced proof-of-concept that does what it says on the tin, with room for future improvements. Read the linked guide by <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/OzzyGT/diffusers-image-fill">OzzyGT</a> for an idea about what's going on under the hood. I prefer dash and interior!

i was planning on combining them into one UI, but gave me a headache.. and video models are dropping left and right!
* I've added a model loader for the Inpaint app - I'll add it to the outpaint one soon. They're still diffuser format model folders. I'll look into switching to single-file at some point. You can manually add more by editing `app.py`. You can't miss the MODEL library near the top. Has to be diffuser models, ie from Huggingface NOT Civitai (at this stage). Just follow the format of the existing models. They'll automagically appear in the UI model drop-down on next app start. Some models work better than others - some work very poorly - I've tried quite a few and Realism Engine seemed the best. Maybe some scheduler issues. will look into it sometime. Uncheck the `paste back background` option if the mask outline is too noticeable. It's particularly bad against high bokeh background for _reasons_.
* ~~Will add negative prompt box, and maybe a LoRA loader. Although will be unusable unless you have a 3090/4090...~~
* oh and the Zoom app. it's pretty cool, but i just haven't had time to even start on it.  you could smooth it out; increase the resolution, which would greatly improve quality; and steer the zoom, re-using the Outpaint app's masking functions... The world is a giant playpen. so many toys! :)
* Adding FastSAM for inpaint masking would be cool as well. and switching to flux models...
* Imo, this is a fantastic app for prepping images for a Flux upscale. It's also great at generative fill compared to other alternatives. I was close to adding an upscaler using the Promax ControlNet, but I can't afford to spend anymore time on it! 

* oh, and it's mostly written by ClaudeAI ;) long as you know what you want, you can eventually do it. just have to watch for its love for creating new functions to fix broken functions.. and next minute you have half a dozen functions related to resizing an input image haha! it's effective but messy. i could spend ages refactoring, but it works well enough :)
* Enjoy!

Yes, this means you should tinker. Pinokio was built for tinkering.
